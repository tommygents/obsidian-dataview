# obsidian-dataview

This is a collection of code snippets I've written to return a subset of notes from a repository I maintain in software called Obsidian. The notes themselves are markdown files.

The snippets are written in DataviewJS, which you can read more about here:https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/
